## Assumptions

- The application is assumed to be deployed in a test or staging environment with frontend and backend services accessible.
- JWT tokens are generated by the backend after successful login and used for accessing protected routes.
- JWT tokens have a fixed expiration time, after which the user must log in again.
- Backend validations are enforced even if UI-level validation is bypassed.
- Rate limiting is applied per IP address, allowing a maximum of 10 attempts per hour.
