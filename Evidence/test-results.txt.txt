2. Automation Scripting:
   - Scripts written in Playwright (auth.spec.js) covering 5 key scenarios.
   - Code logic reviewed for element selection and assertions.
   - Key flows automated:
     a. Registration (Happy Path)
     b. Duplicate Email handling
     c. Login (Happy Path)
     d. Invalid Login handling
     e. Unauthenticated Access Redirection

3. Summary:
